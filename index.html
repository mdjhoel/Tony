      <h3>May 14</h3>
      <h5>Plan</h5>
      <p>Install Linux on an old PC. Install Minecraft Forge and use terminal and gradlew to install. Make Tony Block and get Lightning Sword working.</p>
      <p>Time permitting: <a href="https://mdjhoel.github.io/datacourse/cookie.pdf" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a></p>
      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <p>Tony installed Linux Mint on an older Dell Inspiron and learned some of the benefits of the Linux movement. In addition, he learned some of the shell commands (ls, pwd, cd and cd ..) at the terminal, which lead into a good discussion of Commodore 64s and the history of computing. We tried and failed to install Minecraft Forge, as it was taking too long to get all dependencies working. Completed "cookie clicker" tutorial. Tony wanted to get his own cookie image, demonstrating his creative side and would not rest until he got his program working.</p>
